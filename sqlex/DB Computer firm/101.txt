Task: 
The Printer table is sorted by the code field in ascending order.
The ordered rows form groups: the first group starts with the first row, each row having color=’n’ begins a new group, the groups of rows don’t overlap.
For each group, determine the maximum value of the model field (max_model), the number of unique printer types (distinct_types_cou), and the average price (avg_price).
For all table rows, display code, model, color, type, price, max_model, distinct_types_cou, avg_price.


Solution:
SELECT code, model, color, type, price,
  MAX(model)OVER(PARTITION BY Grp)max_model,
  MAX(CASE type WHEN'Laser'THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)OVER(PARTITION BY Grp)+
  MAX(CASE type WHEN'Matrix'THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)OVER(PARTITION BY Grp)+
  MAX(CASE type WHEN'Jet'THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)OVER(PARTITION BY Grp)distinct_types,
  AVG(price)OVER(PARTITION BY Grp)
FROM(
  SELECT *,
    CASE color WHEN'n'THEN 0 ELSE ROW_NUMBER()OVER(ORDER BY code)END+
    CASE color WHEN'n'THEN 1 ELSE-1 END*ROW_NUMBER()OVER(PARTITION BY color ORDER BY code)Grp
  FROM Printer
