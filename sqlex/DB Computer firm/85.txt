Task: 
Get makers producing either printers only or personal computers only; in case of PC manufacturers they should produce at least 3 models.

Solution:
SELECT maker FROM product
GROUP BY maker
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT type) = 1 AND
       (MIN(type) = 'printer' OR
       (MIN(type) = 'pc' and COUNT(model) >= 3))
