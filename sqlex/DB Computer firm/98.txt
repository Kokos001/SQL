Task:
Display the list of PCs, for each of which the result of the bitwise OR operation performed on the binary representations of its respective processor speed and RAM capacity contains a sequence of at least four consecutive bits set to 1.
Result set: PC code, processor speed, RAM capacity.

Solution:
WITH CTE AS (SELECT 1 n, cast (0 as varchar(16)) bit_or, code, speed, ram FROM PC
UNION ALL
select n*2,
cast (convert(bit,(speed|ram)&n) as varchar(1))+cast(bit_or as varchar(15)),
code, speed, ram
FROM CTE WHERE n < 65536
)

SELECT code, speed, ram FROM CTE
WHERE n = 65536 AND CHARINDEX('1111', bit_or )> 0
