Task:
Assuming the PC table is sorted by code in ascending order, find the average price for each group of six consecutive personal computers.
Result set: the first code value in a set of six records, average price for the respective set.

Solution:
WITH CTE(code,price,number)
AS (SELECT PC.code,PC.price, number= ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY PC.code)
FROM PC)

SELECT CTE.code, AVG(C.price)
FROM CTE
JOIN CTE C ON (C.number-CTE.number)<6 AND (C.number-CTE.number)> =0
GROUP BY CTE.number,CTE.code
HAVING COUNT(CTE.number)=6
