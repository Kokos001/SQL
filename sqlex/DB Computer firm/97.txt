Task:
From the Laptop table, select rows fulfilling the following condition:
the values of the speed, ram, price, and screen columns can be arranged in such a way that each successive value exceeds two or more times the previous one.
Note: all known laptop characteristics are greater than zero.
Output: code, speed, ram, price, screen.

Solution:
WITH t AS (SELECT row_number() over(partition BY code ORDER BY code,feat) num, feat, code FROM (SELECT speed feat, code FROM laptop
UNION ALL
SELECT ram, code FROM laptop
UNION ALL
SELECT price, code FROM laptop
UNION ALL
SELECT screen, code FROM laptop)aa)

SELECT code,speed,ram,price,screen FROM laptop WHERE code in (SELECT code FROM (SELECT [code],[1],[2],[3],[4] FROM t x pivot (min(feat) for num in ([1],[2],[3],[4]))pvt)aa WHERE [4]/[3]>=2 AND [3]/[2]>=2 AND [2]/[1]>=2)
