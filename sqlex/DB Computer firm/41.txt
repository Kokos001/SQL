            FROM (
                SELECT P.maker, a.price
                FROM Product P
                INNER JOIN (
                    SELECT DISTINCT model, price
                    FROM PC
                    UNION ALL
                    SELECT DISTINCT model, price
                    FROM Laptop
                    UNION ALL
                    SELECT DISTINCT model, price
                    FROM Printer
                ) a ON P.model = a.model
                WHERE a.price IS NULL
            ) b
        ) THEN NULL
        ELSE MAX(price)
    END AS max_price
FROM (
    SELECT P.maker, a.price
    FROM Product P
    INNER JOIN (
        SELECT DISTINCT model, price
        FROM PC
        UNION ALL
