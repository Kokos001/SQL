Task:
For each product type and maker in the Product table, find out, with a precision of two decimal places, the percentage ratio of the number of models of the actual type produced by the actual maker to the total number of models by this maker.
Result set: maker, product type, the percentage ratio mentioned above.
Solution:
SELECT main_maker ,main_type ,CONVERT(NUMERIC(6,2),((sub_num*100.00)/(total_num*100.00)*100.00))  
FROM (SELECT COUNT(p5.model) total_num ,p5.maker main_maker 
FROM product p5 
GROUP BY p5.maker) p6 
JOIN (SELECT p3.maker sub_maker ,p3.type main_type ,COUNT(p4.model) sub_num 
FROM (SELECT p1.maker maker, p2.type type 
FROM product p1 
CROSS JOIN product p2 
GROUP BY p1.maker, p2.type) p3 
LEFT JOIN product p4 on p3.maker = p4.maker and p3.type = p4.type 
GROUP BY  p3.maker,p3.type) p7 
ON p7.sub_maker = p6.main_maker
ORDER BY main_maker
