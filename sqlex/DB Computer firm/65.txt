Task:
Number the unique pairs {maker, type} in the Product table, ordering them as follows:
- maker name in ascending order;
- type of product (type) in the order PC, Laptop, Printer.
If a manufacturer produces more than one type of product, its name should be displayed in the first row only;
other rows for THIS manufacturer should contain an empty string (').

Solution:
SELECT num, CASE WHEN ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY maker ORDER BY maker) = 1 THEN maker ELSE '' END AS maker, type FROM
(SELECT row_number() over(ORDER BY maker, case WHEN type = 'PC' THEN 1 WHEN type = 'Laptop' THEN 2 ELSE 3 END) num, maker, type FROM (
SELECT DISTINCT maker, type FROM Product) a) b
