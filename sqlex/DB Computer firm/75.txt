    MAX(l.price) AS max_laptop_price,
    MAX(pc.price) AS max_pc_price,
    MAX(pr.price) AS max_printer_price
FROM Product p
LEFT JOIN Laptop l ON p.model = l.model
LEFT JOIN PC pc ON p.model = pc.model
LEFT JOIN Printer pr ON p.model = pr.model
WHERE 
    l.price IS NOT NULL OR
    pc.price IS NOT NULL OR
    pr.price IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY p.maker
