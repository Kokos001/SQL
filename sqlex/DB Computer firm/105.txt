Task:
Statisticians Alice, Betty, Carol and Diana are numbering rows in the Product table.
Initially, all of them have sorted the table rows in ascending order by the names of the makers.
Alice assigns a new number to each row, sorting the rows belonging to the same maker by model in ascending order.
The other three statisticians assign identical numbers to all rows having the same maker.
Betty assigns the numbers starting with one, increasing the number by 1 for each next maker.
Carol gives a maker the same number the row with this maker's first model receives from Alice.
Diana assigns a maker the same number the row with this maker's last model receives from Alice.
Output: maker, model, row numbers assigned by Alice, Betty, Carol, and Diana respectively.

Solution:
SELECT maker, model, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY maker, model) AS A,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY maker) AS B,
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY maker) AS C,
COUNT(*) OVER (ORDER BY maker) AS D
FROM Product
