Task:
Only Income_o and Outcome_o tables are considered. It is known that no money transactions are performed on Sundays.
For each buy-back center (point) and each funds receipt date, determine the encashment date according to the following rules:
1. The encashment date is the same as the receipt date if there is no payment entry in the Outcome_o table for this date and point.
2. Otherwise, the first possible date after the receipt date is used that doesn’t fall on Sunday and doesn’t have a corresponding payment entry in the Outcome_o table for the point in question.
Output: point, receipt date, encashment date.

Solution:
