Task:
Write a query that displays all operations from the Income and Outcome tables as follows:
date, sequential record number for this date, buy-back center receiving funds, funds received, buy-back center making a payment, payment amount.
All revenue transactions for all centers made during a single day are ordered by the code field, and so are all expense transactions.
If the numbers of revenue and expense transactions are different for a day, display NULL in the corresponding columns for missing operations.

Solution:
SELECT DISTINCT A.date , A.R, B.point, B.inc, C.point, C.out
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT date, ROW_Number() OVER(PARTITION BY date ORDER BY code ASC) AS R FROM Income
UNION SELECT DISTINCT date, ROW_Number() OVER(PARTITION BY date ORDER BY code ASC) FROM Outcome) A
LEFT JOIN (SELECT date, point, inc
                , ROW_Number() OVER(PARTITION BY date ORDER BY code ASC) AS RI FROM Income
           ) B ON B.date=A.date AND B.RI=A.R
LEFT JOIN (SELECT date, point, out
                , ROW_Number() OVER(PARTITION BY date ORDER BY code ASC) as RO FROM Outcome
           ) C ON C.date=A.date AND C.RO=A.R
