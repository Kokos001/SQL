Task: 
One of the characteristics of a ship is one-half the cube of the calibre of its main guns (mw).
Determine the average ship mw with an accuracy of two decimal places for each country having ships in the database.
Solution:
SELECT country, FORMAT(AVG(0.5 * POWER(bore, 3)), '0.00') AS avg_mw FROM 
(SELECT c.country, c.bore, c.class, s.name
FROM Classes c
LEFT JOIN Ships s ON c.class = s.class
WHERE s.name IS NOT NULL
UNION 
SELECT c.country, c.bore, c.class, o.ship
FROM Classes c
LEFT JOIN Outcomes o ON c.class = o.ship
WHERE o.ship NOT IN (SELECT name FROM Ships)
) b
GROUP BY country
