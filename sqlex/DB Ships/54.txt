Task:
With a precision of two decimal places, determine the average number of guns for all battleships (including the ones in the Outcomes table).
Solution:
SELECT CAST(AVG(numGuns) AS DECIMAL(5, 2)) as AVG_numGuns FROM
(SELECT CAST(numGuns AS DECIMAL(5, 2)) AS numGuns FROM (SELECT name, numGuns FROM Classes
JOIN Ships ON Classes.class = Ships.class
WHERE type = 'bb'
UNION
SELECT ship, numGuns FROM Classes
JOIN Outcomes ON class = ship
WHERE type = 'bb') a
) b
