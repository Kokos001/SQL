Find out the names of the ships in the Ships table that meet at least four criteria from the following list:
numGuns = 8,
bore = 15,
displacement = 32000,
type = bb,
launched = 1915,

country = USA.

Solution:
WITH T AS (SELECT Ships.name, Classes.*, Ships.launched  FROM Ships JOIN Classes ON Ships.class= Classes.class)

SELECT name FROM (
SELECT name, CASE WHEN numGuns = 8 THEN 1  END AS s FROM T
UNION
SELECT name, CASE  WHEN bore = 15 THEN 2 END FROM T
UNION
SELECT name, CASE  WHEN displacement = 32000 THEN 3 END FROM T
UNION
SELECT name, CASE  WHEN type = 'bb' THEN 4 END FROM T
UNION
SELECT name, CASE  WHEN launched = 1915 THEN 5 END FROM T
UNION
SELECT name, CASE  WHEN class ='Kongo' THEN 6 END FROM T
UNION
SELECT name, CASE  WHEN country = 'USA' THEN 7 END FROM T)  a
GROUP BY name
