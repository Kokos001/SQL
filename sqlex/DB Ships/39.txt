Task: 
Find the ships that `survived for future battles`; that is, after being damaged in a battle, they participated in another one, which occurred later.
Solution:
SELECT DISTINCT o.ship FROM Outcomes o
JOIN Battles b ON o.battle = b.name
JOIN (SELECT o.ship, MAX(b.date) as max_date FROM Outcomes o
JOIN Battles b ON o.battle = b.name
GROUP BY o.ship)  AS Max ON o.ship = Max.ship
WHERE result = 'damaged' AND date < max_date
