Solution:
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM (
SELECT DISTINCT CASE WHEN (type = 'bb' OR type IS NULL) 
AND (country = 'Japan' OR country IS NULL ) 
AND (numGuns >= 9 OR numGuns IS NULL)
AND (bore < 19 OR bore IS NULL)
AND (displacement <= 65000 OR displacement IS NULL) 
THEN name END name
FROM (SELECT name, type, country, numGuns, bore, displacement FROM classes JOIN Ships
ON classes.class = ships.class
) this_table ) table_2 WHERE name IS NOT NULL
