Task:
For classes having irreparable combat losses and at least three ships in the database, display the name of the class and the number of ships sunk.

Solution:
SELECT Classes.class, COUNT(result) as Sunks FROM Classes  JOIN 
(SELECT ship, CASE WHEN class IS NULL THEN ship ELSE class END AS class, 
result FROM Outcomes left join Ships 
ON ship = name WHERE result = 'sunk') a ON Classes.class = a.class
GROUP BY Classes.class
HAVING Classes.class IN (SELECT class FROM (
SELECT ship, CASE WHEN class IS NULL THEN ship ELSE class END AS class FROM Outcomes left join Ships 
ON ship = name
UNION 
SELECT name, class FROM Ships) a
GROUP BY class
HAVING count(ship) >= 3
)
