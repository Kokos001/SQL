Task:
For each cruiser class whose quantity of guns is known, number its guns sequentially beginning with 1.
Output: class name, gun ordinal number in 'bc-N' style.

Solution:
WITH tab AS (
  SELECT class, numGuns, CAST(numGuns AS INTEGER) AS n 
  FROM Classes
  WHERE type = 'bc'
),
rec AS (
  SELECT * FROM tab
  UNION ALL 
  SELECT r.class, r.numGuns, CASE WHEN r.n > 1 THEN r.n - 1 END
  FROM rec r
  WHERE r.n > 0
)
SELECT class, CONCAT('bc-', n) FROM rec
WHERE n IS NOT NULL
