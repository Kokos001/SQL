Task:
Find the names of the ships with the largest number of guns among all ships having the same displacement (including ships in the Outcomes table).
Solution:
SELECT name FROM
(SELECT name, numGuns, displacement FROM Classes
JOIN Ships ON Classes.class = Ships.class
UNION
SELECT ship, numGuns, displacement FROM Classes
JOIN Outcomes ON class = ship) a 
JOIN 
(SELECT MAX(numGuns) as max_guns, displacement FROM (SELECT name, numGuns, displacement FROM Classes
JOIN Ships ON Classes.class = Ships.class
UNION
SELECT ship, numGuns, displacement FROM Classes
JOIN Outcomes ON class = ship) aa
GROUP BY displacement) b ON a.numGuns = b.max_guns AND a.displacement = b.displacement
