Solution:
WITH L AS (SELECT V_ID  from utV JOIN utB 
ON utv.V_ID = utB.B_V_ID
WHERE V_COLOR = 'R'
GROUP BY V_ID
HAVING COUNT(B_DATETIME) > 1),

 sq AS (SELECT DISTINCT B_Q_ID from utV JOIN utB 
ON utv.V_ID = utB.B_V_ID
WHERE V_COLOR = 'B')

SELECT DISTINCT V_NAME from utV JOIN utB 
ON utv.V_ID = utB.B_V_ID
WHERE V_ID IN (SELECT * from L) AND B_Q_ID IN (SELECT * from sq)
