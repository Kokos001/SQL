Task:
What maximal number of black squares could be colored white using the remaining paint?


Solution:
WITH t AS (SELECT V_color, SUM(cnt) as All_sum FROM (
SELECT V_color, 255 as cnt FROM utv) a
GROUP BY V_color),

sp AS (SELECT V_color, SUM(B_VOL) as spent FROM utB JOIN utv
ON utB.B_V_ID = utv.V_ID 
GROUP BY V_COLOR)

SELECT FLOOR(MIN(d)/ 255) FROM (SELECT t.V_color, All_sum - spent AS d FROM t JOIN sp 
ON t.V_color = sp.V_color) x
