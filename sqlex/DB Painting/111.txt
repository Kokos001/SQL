Task:
Get the squares that are NEITHER white NOR black, and painted with different colors in a 1:1:1 ratio. Result set: square name, paint quantity for a single color.

Solution:
WITH t AS (SELECT B_Q_ID, V_COLOR, sum(B_VOL) vol
FROM utB, utV
WHERE B_V_ID=V_ID
GROUP BY B_Q_ID, V_COLOR
HAVING SUM(B_VOL) != 0 AND SUM(B_VOL) != 255)


SELECT B_Q_ID, AVG(vol) AS V
FROM t 
WHERE B_Q_ID IN (
    SELECT B_Q_ID 
    FROM t 
    GROUP BY B_Q_ID
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT V_COLOR) = 3
)
GROUP BY B_Q_ID
HAVING MIN(vol) = MAX(vol)
