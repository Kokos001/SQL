Solution:
WITH t AS (
    SELECT * FROM utq 
    JOIN utb ON utq.Q_ID = utb.b_Q_ID
    JOIN utv ON utb.b_v_ID = utv.V_ID
),
t1 AS (SELECT * FROM t WHERE v_id IN (SELECT v_id FROM (SELECT v_id FROM t GROUP BY v_id HAVING SUM (b_vol) = 255) a))

SELECT Q_NAME FROM (
SELECT Q_NAME, CONCAT(vol, v_color) as vol_c FROM (
SELECT Q_NAME, SUM(B_VOL) as vol, V_COLOR FROM t1
GROUP BY Q_NAME, V_COLOR
HAVING SUM(B_VOL) = 255) b) c
GROUP BY Q_NAME HAVING STRING_AGG(vol_c, '-') = '255B-255G-255R'
