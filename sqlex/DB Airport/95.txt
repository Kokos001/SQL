Task:
Using the Pass_in_Trip table, calculate for each airline:
1) the number of performed flights;
2) the number of plane types used;
3) the number of different passengers that have been transported;
4) the total number of passengers that have been transported by the company.
Output: airline name, 1), 2), 3), 4).

Solution:
WITH t AS (SELECT c.name, pt.trip_no, date, ID_psg, plane
FROM Pass_in_Trip pt JOIN Trip t
ON pt.trip_no = t.trip_no JOIN Company c
ON t.ID_comp = c.ID_comp), 

f AS (SELECT name, COUNT(trip_no) flights FROM (SELECT DISTINCT name, trip_no, date FROM t) a 
GROUP BY name),

p AS (SELECT name, COUNT(plane) AS planes FROM (SELECT DISTINCT name, plane FROM t) b
GROUP BY name),

d AS (SELECT name, COUNT(ID_psg) AS diff FROM (SELECT DISTINCT name, ID_psg FROM t) c
GROUP BY name),

tot AS (SELECT name, COUNT(ID_psg) AS total FROM t GROUP BY name)

SELECT f.*, planes, diff, total FROM f JOIN p ON f.name = p.name
JOIN d ON f.name = d.name
JOIN tot ON f.name = tot.name
