Task: 
Find out the three smallest and three greatest trip numbers. Output them in a single row with six columns, ordered from the least trip number to the greatest one.
Note: it is assumed the Trip table contains 6 or more rows.


Solution:
SELECT
    MAX(CASE WHEN rn = 1 THEN trip_no ELSE NULL END) AS Column1,
    MAX(CASE WHEN rn = 2 THEN trip_no ELSE NULL END) AS Column2,
    MAX(CASE WHEN rn = 3 THEN trip_no ELSE NULL END) AS Column3,
    MAX(CASE WHEN rn = 4 THEN trip_no ELSE NULL END) AS Column4,
    MAX(CASE WHEN rn = 5 THEN trip_no ELSE NULL END) AS Column5,
    MAX(CASE WHEN rn = 6 THEN trip_no ELSE NULL END) AS Column6
FROM (
    SELECT trip_no, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY trip_no) AS rn
    FROM (
        SELECT TOP 3 trip_no FROM Trip
        ORDER BY trip_no
        UNION ALL
        SELECT TOP 3 trip_no FROM Trip
        ORDER BY trip_no DESC
    ) AS subquery
) AS numbered_results
