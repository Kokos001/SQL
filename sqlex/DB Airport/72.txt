Task: 
Among the customers using a single airline, find distinct passengers who have flown most frequently. Result set: passenger name, number of trips.

Solution:
SELECT TOP 1 WITH TIES name, maxs FROM passenger JOIN 
(SELECT pID, max(counts) maxs FROM ( 
SELECT pass_in_trip.ID_psg pID, Trip.ID_comp, count(*) counts 
FROM pass_in_trip JOIN trip ON trip.trip_no = pass_in_trip.trip_no
GROUP BY pass_in_trip.ID_psg, Trip.ID_comp
) AS R GROUP BY pID HAVING count(*) = 1
) AS R1 ON ID_psg = pID ORDER BY maxs DESC
