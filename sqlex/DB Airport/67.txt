Task:
Find out the number of routes with the greatest number of flights (trips).

Solution:
SELECT COUNT(tf) AS qty FROM 
(SELECT town_from as tf, town_to, COUNT(plane) AS cp FROM Trip 
GROUP BY town_from, town_to 
HAVING COUNT(plane) >= ALL 
(SELECT COUNT(plane)  FROM Trip 
GROUP BY town_from, town_to) ) AS b
