Task:
Get the passengers who, compared to others, spent most time flying.
Result set: passenger name, total flight duration in minutes.

Solution:
WITH TB AS (
SELECT ID_psg,  SUM(CASE WHEN time_in > time_out THEN DATEDIFF(mi, time_out, time_in)
ELSE DATEDIFF (minute, time_out, DATEADD(DAY,IIF(time_in<time_out,1,0),time_in)) END) AS min
FROM Pass_in_trip p JOIN
Trip t ON p.trip_no = t.trip_no
GROUP BY ID_psg)

SELECT name, min FROM Passenger JOIN (
SELECT ID_psg, min FROM TB 
WHERE min = (Select MAX(min) FROM TB)) b
ON Passenger.ID_psg = b.ID_psg
