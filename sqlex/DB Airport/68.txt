Task:
Find out the number of routes with the greatest number of flights (trips).
Notes.
1) A - B and B - A are to be considered the SAME route.
2) Use the Trip table only.

Solution:
WITH rc AS (
  SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS routes FROM trip
  GROUP BY
    CASE WHEN town_from > town_to THEN town_from ELSE town_to end,
    CASE WHEN town_from < town_to THEN town_from ELSE town_to end)

SELECT COUNT0(*) AS route_count FROM rc
WHERE routes=(SELECT MAX(routes) FROM rc)
