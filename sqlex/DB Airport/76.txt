Result set: passenger name, flight duration in minutes.
Solution:
SELECT name, sum_time FROM (
SELECT ID_psg, SUM(minutes) AS sum_time FROM (
SELECT ID_psg, DATEDIFF (minute, time_out, DATEADD(DAY,IIF(time_in<time_out,1,0),time_in)) as minutes FROM (
SELECT ID_psg, trip_no FROM Pass_in_trip
WHERE ID_psg NOT IN (
SELECT DISTINCT ID_psg FROM Pass_in_trip
GROUP BY ID_psg, place
HAVING COUNT(place) > 1)) a LEFT JOIN Trip
ON a.trip_no = Trip.trip_no) b
GROUP BY ID_psg) c LEFT JOIN Passenger p
ON c.ID_psg = p.ID_psg
