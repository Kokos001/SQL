Task:
Supposing a passenger lives in the town his first flight departs from, find non-Muscovites who have visited Moscow more than once.

Solution:
WITH t AS (
  -- passangers and their trips
  SELECT pit.date, id_psg, t.*
  FROM pass_in_trip pit
  JOIN trip t ON pit.trip_no=t.trip_no
)
, fo AS (
  -- get first fly date+time
  SELECT id_psg, MIN(date+time_out) as date_out
  FROM t GROUP BY id_psg
)
, nm as (
  -- those who are not from Moscow
  SELECT fo.id_psg
  FROM fo join t ON fo.date_out=(t.date+t.time_out)
  WHERE town_from!='Moscow'
)

SELECT
  p.name, count(*)
FROM t JOIN passenger p ON t.id_psg=p.id_psg
WHERE town_to='Moscow' AND t.id_psg IN (SELECT * FROM nm)
GROUP BY t.id_psg, p.name
HAVING count(*) > 1
