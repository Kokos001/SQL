Task:
Among those flying with a single airline find the names of different passengers who have flown most often.
Result set: passenger name, number of trips, and airline name.

Solution:
SELECT (
	SELECT name FROM Passenger 
	WHERE ID_psg = R.ID_psg
) AS name, R.trip_Qty, (
	SELECT name FROM Company 
	WHERE ID_comp = R.ID_comp
) AS Company 
FROM (
	SELECT Pass_in_trip.ID_psg, MIN(Trip.ID_comp) AS ID_comp, 
	COUNT(*) AS trip_Qty, MAX(COUNT(*)) OVER() AS Max_Qty 
	FROM Pass_in_trip 
	INNER JOIN Trip ON Pass_in_trip.trip_no = Trip.trip_no 
	GROUP BY Pass_in_trip.ID_psg 
	HAVING MIN(Trip.ID_comp) = MAX(Trip.ID_comp) 
) AS R 
WHERE R.trip_Qty = R.Max_Qty
